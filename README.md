## Contents

### Simple plotting - subfolder simple
* Typical examples of creating xy-plots from data extracted from log files etc.

### Contact maps - matrix representation of protein residues close to each other - subfolder contacts
* promiximity information provided bt Gromacs filtered and visualized with a color matrix highlighting spatial proximity

### 1D and 2D density plots - subfolder density
* Time average data from Gromacs MD simulations represented in 1D and 2D plots aiding understanding the numerical data
* Additional analysis to enable estimating uncertainty

### Animated graphs - turn a simple plot into an animation
* Uses matplotlib animation tool
